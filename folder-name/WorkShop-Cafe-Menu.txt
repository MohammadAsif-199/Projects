☕ Project Summary: Camper Cafe Menu Website
📄 Purpose:
To create a visually appealing, responsive cafe menu webpage showcasing coffee and dessert items, using structured HTML and clean CSS styling.

🧱 HTML Structure:
<main> Section:

Header with cafe name and established year.

Two menu sections:

☕ Coffee (French Vanilla, Caramel Macchiato, etc.)

🍰 Desserts (Donut, Cherry Pie, etc.)

Each item uses <article class="item"> with price and flavor/dessert.

Images for each section (coffee and pie icons).

Footer with a link to the website and an address.

🎨 CSS Styling Highlights:
Background: Coffee bean image creates a cafe ambiance.

Typography: Impact font for headings; center-aligned text.

Layout:

Menu is centered using margin: auto with a max-width of 500px.

Each item uses inline-block to align name and price on one line.

Styling:

Soft burlywood background for menu.

Brown horizontal lines (<hr>) for visual separation.

Responsive: Basic responsiveness via width: 80% and viewport meta tag.

🔗 Footer Styling:
Uses <address> with normal font style (overriding italic default).

Link colors stay black, change to brown on hover or click.
